# AR Hardware

AR Hardware is an innovative e-commerce platform that allows users to purchase hardware products. It integrates augmented reality (AR) and image processing, enabling users to visualize how paint colors will look on a wall before making a purchase. The platform also features a vendor dashboard for managing orders and inventory, built using Flutter for the frontend and Flask API for backend processing.

## Features

- **AR Visualization**: Allows users to apply different paint colors to a wall using their phone's camera.
- **Product Purchase**: Users can browse and purchase hardware products directly from the app.
- **Vendor Dashboard**: Vendors can manage orders, update product listings, and track sales.
- **Order Management**: Seamless order placement and tracking system for users and vendors.
- **Image Processing**: Uses a Flask API for real-time image processing to simulate paint colors.

## Tech Stack
